# CodeForces dataset
Collected sollutions from codeforces.com programming competition.

Each contest is in individual file with coresponding ID (https://codeforces.com/contest/<ID>) in contests folder.
File authors.csv includes authors metadata, use author_url field as foreign key when joining.
  
This dataset is primarily focused on stylometry problems (authorship attribution, profiling and so on). It can be also used for example for source code generation (https://www.deepmind.com/blog/competitive-programming-with-alphacode) - I will add tasks texts later.
